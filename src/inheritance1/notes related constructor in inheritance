Note 1 : Inside constructor you must be super() must be first statement
Note 2 : You can not write this() and super() in same constructor because
		 both should be the first statement
Note 3: If you have child constructor and inside that you call 
		super() and in your parent class there is no default constructor then what happen?
		ANS--> your code will be compile fine and execute fine because 
				by default if there is no constructor then zero argument constructor will call by JVM.
Note 4: If you can not write super() keyword inside the constructor then by default compiler call super()
		and this super() always call default constructor of parent class
Note 5 :If you have Child class object but there is no constructor you write then by default
		compiler call Zero argument constructor that contains the super() and that 
		super() call parent class object
